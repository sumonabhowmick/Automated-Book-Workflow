**Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south.

Behind him, waves from the open ocean crashed, sending mist into the wind. In front of him stretched the lagoon of Karolin—vast, blue, and calm like a lake, with gulls flying overhead.

This enormous lagoon, surrounded by a forty-mile coral ring, was like a private sea. Sometimes stormy, sometimes serene—it now belonged to him. He had arrived just yesterday.

On the sunlit beach, women, children, and young men fished, played, and tended gardens. They were his people now. The canoes on the shore were his. Even the empty longhouses, once home to war canoes, were now his.

But as he glanced at the canoe houses, his expression darkened. He turned away from the peaceful lagoon to face the wild northern sea. Far beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree Island—a place beautiful like a dream, but crawling with devils.

Nearby, little Tari, the net maker’s son, sat on the coral and looked up at Dick. Tari didn’t know much, but he knew the war had wiped out all the men of Karolin, leaving only women and children—leaderless and vulnerable.

Then, yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the north. He came in a strange boat with Katafa, a girl once lost at sea. The women said the gods had sent this man to be their new chief.

Tari didn’t care about gods. Alone with this mysterious man, and out of earshot of his mother, he asked simply, “Taori, who are you?”

Even if Dick had answered in his old language, would the child have understood? Could he say, “Tari, I’m Dick Lestrange. I come from a world far from here. As a child, I was shipwrecked on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney, who raised me. We fished, sailed, and he made me toy boats. One day, Katafa arrived, lost from Karolin. She stayed with us until Kearney died. Then it was just us. She taught me her language and gave me the name Taori. We fell in love. But a ship came with cruel men from the east. They rebelled, burned the ship, and killed the crew. We escaped with what we had and sailed here, following the glow of your lagoon.”

But Dick couldn’t explain any of this. He had forgotten his real name—and his native tongue. Kearney was now a fading memory. Life, for him, truly began when Katafa arrived. Only the toy ships reminded him of the old sailor.

He looked down at the child. “I am Taori,” he said softly. “Why do you ask, little Tari?”

“I don’t know,” Tari shrugged. “I just ask things. Grown-ups never answer.” Then his eyes lit up. “Oh! Look at the fish!” And off he ran to join other kids pulling in a net.

Dick turned north. Tari’s question had unlocked a memory—the burning ship, their escape, the people who now believed he was sent by the gods.

He wasn’t afraid—not yet. The men on Palm Tree had no boats. But they would build them. And when they did, they would see the glow of Karolin’s lagoon and come. It might take time, but they would come.

On the outside, Dick was like the islanders. But inside, he still had the mind to plan, to imagine the future.

That morning, he had sent for three old men—Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. They were too old to fight, but they were master canoe builders. He looked at the boys on the beach, soon to be warriors. And in his heart, he knew he was doing all this for Katafa.

He would build war canoes. Was he preparing to defend? Or planning to strike first? Only he knew.

A hand touched his shoulder. It was Katafa. Wind caught a strand of her dark hair, lifting it like a feather. Her deep eyes stared at the northern horizon.

“Look,” she said.

Palm Tree appeared, like a ghostly painting in the air. A mirage made it visible, rising from the sea—clear but unreal.

They stood silently. To them, it wasn’t a mirage—it was the place they had fled. And it was watching.

They remembered the savages, the drunken screams, the burning ship, and the night of their escape. Now that place stood before them, calm and lovely, but hiding evil.

Dick’s nostrils flared. They had threatened him—fine. But they had threatened Katafa. And that he would not allow.

Someday, those men would come. They had no women. Karolin had many. Just as he had been drawn to Katafa, they would come too.

He didn’t know that danger wasn’t only to the north. It was everywhere—driven by the savagery of both so-called wild men and so-called civilized ones.

To Dick, the world was just two islands and the ocean between. No Europe, no America—only his and Katafa’s story. But already he understood the heart of human history: greed, war, destruction.

Palm Tree faded, like a dream vanishing.

Katafa pointed. A canoe was approaching.

It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Together, they walked toward the beach to meet it.
