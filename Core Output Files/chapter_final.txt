Of course. Here is the chapter "The Gates of Morning" rewritten in simpler, modern English.

### **Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge and looked south.

Behind him, the massive waves of the open ocean crashed against the reef, sending a spray of salty mist into the wind. But in front of him, the lagoon of Karolin was as calm as a lake—an endless expanse of blue, with fishing gulls circling overhead.

This huge body of water, enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a sea in itself. It could be stormy in high winds or a sheet of glass in a light breeze. And it was his, even though he had only arrived yesterday.

The people on the beach below—women, children, and teenagers—were busy in the blazing sun. Some were fishing with nets, others were playing games or tending to their small gardens. They were all his people now. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his, as were the empty longhouses where war canoes had once been stored.

When his gaze shifted from the lagoon to those empty longhouses, he frowned. He turned his back on the calm water and faced the crashing breakers of the northern sea. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay an island called Palm Tree. It was as beautiful as a dream, but it was swarming with men he thought of as devils.

Nearby, a little boy named Tari sat on the coral and looked up at him. Tari didn't know much, but he knew that a war had taken all of Karolin’s men, leaving the women and children defenseless. Then yesterday, this stranger had arrived from the north. He came in a strange boat with Katafa, a girl from their tribe who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said the gods had sent this man to be their new chief.

The child didn't know or care about gods. Alone with this amazing new person and out of his mother’s earshot, he asked a simple, direct question.

“Taori,” said little Tari, “who are you?”

If Dick could have answered, would the child have understood? Would he have understood the strange story of a boy named Dick Lestrange, who came from a world beyond the islands? A boy who was shipwrecked on Palm Tree when he was even younger than Tari, left with only an old sailor named Kearney. Kearney had raised him, teaching him to fish and build small model ships, unlike the canoes of the islands. Then one day, Katafa arrived, blown there by a storm. She taught him her language, the language of Karolin, and gave him the name Taori. They fell in love. They might have stayed there forever, but a large ship arrived, crewed by violent men from the Melanesian islands. The crew mutinied, killed the white officers, and burned the ship. Dick and Katafa had escaped in their small boat, fleeing to Karolin.

But he couldn’t tell Tari this story. The name "Dick" was gone from his memory, along with the English language he once spoke. Kearney the sailor was a faint, hazy figure from a past that felt like a dream. For someone who had been alone for so long, the distant past was a blur. For Dick, life had truly begun when Katafa arrived on his island. Everything before that was lost, burned away by the tropical sun and washed out by the island's storms.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori," he said gently. "Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," the boy said. "I just ask." Suddenly, his attention shifted. "Oh, fish!" he cried, hearing the shouts of other children pulling in a net. He jumped up and trotted off to join them.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. The child's question brought the memories back. He saw the ship that had been burned, and he saw himself and Katafa escaping in the small boat Kearney had taught him to sail. He saw their landing here just yesterday, and the crowd of women and children who hailed him as a leader sent from the gods.

As he stared north, the memory of the men they had escaped from soured the beautiful day.

There was no immediate threat. The men on Palm Tree had no canoes. But Dick knew they would build them. And when they did, they would eventually see the faint glow in the sky created by Karolin’s huge lagoon, just as he had. And they would come. It might be a long time from now, but they would come.

Dick had been raised as an islander, a warrior. But something of his European heritage remained. He could think ahead, plan, and imagine the future.

That was why he had already sent a canoe to fetch the island's three expert canoe builders—Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—old men who were too frail for war but masters of their craft. It was why his eyes lit up when he saw that nearly a hundred of the tribe's boys were growing into strong young men. But beneath all his planning, driving him, was his love for Katafa. The thought of her being threatened, no matter how vaguely, was unbearable.

War canoes. Was he planning to defend the lagoon, or was he thinking of attacking the danger at its source, before it could ever reach them?

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned and saw Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, freed from the vine that tied it back, blew in the breeze. Her dark, brilliant eyes weren't looking at him, but north, to the exact spot he had been staring at.

"Look," she said.

In certain weather, the island of Palm Tree, though fifty miles away, would appear on the horizon as a mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it was happening again. A mysterious dark spot appeared on the glittering sea, slowly growing clearer until the island was sketched against the sky—a beautiful, shimmering, dreamlike image.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence. They knew nothing of mirages; they only saw the place they had escaped rising from the sea as if to watch them.

The sight brought it all back: the savage men on the beach, the frantic escape in their small boat, and the sound of drunken yells from the men who had stolen rum from the ship they’d burned. There it was—the scene of that horror, now a lovely, silent picture that hid the monsters living there.

As Dick stared at the beautiful, threatening image, his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened him, which was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa, and that was everything. And they still threatened her.

*Some day they will come,* he thought. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm his deepest instincts. They would build canoes and, seeing the lagoon’s reflection in the sky, they would come. Those men had no women. Instinct told him they would be drawn here, to the women of Karolin.

He didn't know that the danger wasn't just from the north. Greed and violence could come from anywhere on that blue sea, from so-called civilized men as well as savages. In his short life, he had already learned the first lesson of history: man's capacity for war and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing as suddenly as a snuffed-out candle. As they turned from the ocean back toward the lagoon, Katafa pointed. A canoe was approaching from the southern shore.

It was the canoe he had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
