Of course. Here is the chapter "The Gates of Morning" rewritten in simpler, more modern English.

### **Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge and looked south.

Behind him, the massive waves of the open ocean crashed against the reef, sending sea spray into the wind. But in front of him, the lagoon of Karolin was as calm as a lake—a vast, endless blue dotted with gulls diving for fish.

This huge lagoon, encircled by a forty-mile coral reef, was like its own private sea. In heavy winds, it could be stormy and dangerous, but in the light breeze of today, it was a peaceful lake of azure. And it all belonged to him, even though he had only arrived yesterday.

The people busy on the beach below—women and children fishing with nets, youths playing games or tending to their gardens—were now his people. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his, as were the empty longhouses where the tribe’s war canoes once sat.

As his gaze shifted from the lagoon to those empty canoe houses, he frowned. He turned away from the calm water and faced the crashing breakers of the open sea to the north. Out there, invisible beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree island. It was an island as beautiful as a dream, but it was crawling with monsters.

Nearby, a little boy named Tari, the net maker’s son, looked up at him. Tari didn't know much about the world, but he knew that a war had wiped out all the men of Karolin, leaving the women and children defenseless, without a leader.

Then yesterday, this stranger had arrived. He came from the north in an unfamiliar boat, and with him was Katafa—a girl from their own tribe who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women were saying the gods had sent this man to be their new chief.

The child didn't know or care about gods. Alone with this fascinating new person, he asked the question that was on his mind with the simple bluntness of a child.

“Taori,” said little Tari, using the name Katafa had given him, “who are you?”

If Dick could have answered, would the boy have even understood the story? A story of a world he’d never seen.

*Tari, I come from a people far beyond this ocean. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was even smaller than you, I was shipwrecked on that island you call Marua—Palm Tree—with an old sailor. We lived there alone. His name was Kearney, and he taught me how to fish and sail. He even made me little toy ships, different from the island canoes. Then one day, Katafa arrived, blown there by a storm just like she said. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then it was just the two of us. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin, and she gave me the name Taori. We fell in love. We might have lived on Marua forever, but a big ship came, filled with evil men from the Melanesian islands. They were hired to cut down trees, but they mutinied, killed the white men in charge, and burned the ship. We escaped in our small boat, taking everything we cared about with us. We steered for Karolin, guided by the glow of its lagoon reflected in the night sky.*

But he couldn't tell Tari all of that. The name "Dick" was gone from his memory, along with the English he once spoke. Kearney, the sailor who raised him, was just a faint figure in the hazy, sun-drenched memories of his childhood. For men who have been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past becomes a blur. For Dick, life truly began when Katafa came to Marua. Everything before that felt as though it had been burned away by the intense tropical sun and the sweeping storms. The only reason he remembered Kearney at all was because of the little toy ships he had made.

He looked down at the curious child. “I am Taori, little Tari. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” the boy said. “I just ask. But the grown-ups never answer.” His attention suddenly shifted. “Look, fish!” he cried, hearing other children shouting as they pulled in a net. He jumped up and ran off to join them.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. The boy’s question had stirred his own memories. He saw the ship that had been burned, and he saw himself and Katafa escaping in the small boat Kearney had taught him to handle. He remembered landing on this very beach yesterday, surrounded by women and children who looked at him as if he were a god sent to lead them.

But as he stared north, the memory of the men they had fled from poisoned the beautiful view.

There was no immediate threat. The mutineers on Palm Tree had no canoes. But they would build them. Dick was sure of it. And just as he had seen the glow of Karolin’s lagoon in the sky, they would see it too. And they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick was a man of the islands now, in body and instinct. But something of the white man he was born as remained. He could think ahead, plan, and imagine the future.

That was why he had sent a canoe to the other side of the lagoon that morning. He had sent it to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old men, too frail for war, but experts at building canoes. It was why, when he looked at his new tribe, he saw not just children, but nearly a hundred boys who would soon be old enough to fight. But underneath it all, driving every thought, was his fierce love for Katafa. She was his other half, more important to him than his own life, and she was in danger.

War canoes. Was he planning to fight the invaders here in the lagoon? Or did he have a bolder, more terrifying idea: to attack them first, and destroy the threat before it could ever reach his shores?

A hand on his shoulder made him turn. It was Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped its vine tie and was blowing back in the breeze like a feather. Her dark, brilliant eyes weren't looking at him, but were fixed on the northern horizon where he had been staring.

“Look,” she said.

In certain weather, Palm Tree, though fifty miles away, would appear on the horizon in a mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it was happening again. A strange smudge appeared on the horizon, a faint stain against the sea’s glare. It slowly deepened and sharpened until, as if drawn by an invisible artist, the island appeared—a clear, dream-like image, beautiful and vivid.

With her hand still on his shoulder, they stood in silence. They didn't understand mirages; they only saw the island they had escaped rising from the sea as if to watch them.

The vision brought it all back: the swarm of violent men on the beach, their shapes like monstrous figures from a nightmare; the wind filling the sail of their little boat as they raced for the open sea; the drunken yells of the mutineers. There it was, the scene of that tragedy, now a lovely, silent picture that hid the demons still living there.

As Dick stared at the beautiful, threatening image, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened him, which was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa, which was everything. And they still threatened her.

One day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm what his gut already told him. They would build canoes, see the lagoon’s light in the sky, and they would come. Those men had no women. Here there were women. A dark instinct told him that just as he was drawn to Katafa, those men would be drawn to the women of Karolin.

He had no idea that danger could come from anywhere on this blue sea—not just from island raiders, but from the so-called civilized world, too. To Dick, the world was only these two islands. He knew nothing of Europe or America; his only history was his own short life. But in that short life, he had learned to fear other men and had come to understand the basic, violent nature of humanity.

Then, as gradually as it appeared, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade. Suddenly, it vanished like a snuffed-out candle. As they turned from the open sea back toward the lagoon, Katafa pointed. A canoe was approaching from the far shore.

It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They left the coral ledge and walked down to the white sand of the lagoon beach to meet it.
