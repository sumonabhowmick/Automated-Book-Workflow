Of course. Here is the chapter "The Gates of Morning" rewritten in simple, modern English.

### **Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge and looked south.

Behind him, the ocean waves crashed against the outer reef, sending spray into the air. In front of him, the vast, calm lagoon of Karolin stretched out like a blue lake, with fishing gulls circling overhead.

This enormous lagoon, enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a sea of its own. It could turn stormy in high winds or be as peaceful as a blue lake when the air was still. And now, it was his—even though he had only arrived the day before.

The people on the beach—the women, children, and young men—were now his people. He saw them fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to their small gardens under the hot sun. The canoes pulled onto the sand were his. Even the empty huts, where war canoes once sat, belonged to him.

But when his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, he frowned. He turned his back on the calm water and faced the crashing waves of the open ocean to the north. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree island. It was an island as beautiful as a dream, but now it was swarming with savages.

Little Tari, the son of the net maker, was sitting on the coral nearby and looked up at him. Tari didn't know much about the world, but he knew that a war had killed all the men of Karolin, leaving the women and children defenseless, without a leader.

Then, just yesterday, this stranger had arrived from the north. He came in a strange boat with Katafa, a girl from their tribe who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said the gods had sent this man to be their new chief.

The child didn't know or care who the gods were. Alone with this amazing new person and out of his mother's hearing, he asked a simple, direct question.

“Taori,” said little Tari, using the island name for Dick, “who are you?”

Even if Dick could have answered, the child wouldn't have understood the strange story. He might have said: *“Tari, I come from a world you’ve never seen. My real name is Dick Lestrange. When I was even smaller than you, I was shipwrecked on that island you call Marua—Palm Tree—fifty miles north of here. An old sailor named Kearney raised me there. He taught me to fish and sail, and he carved me little toy ships, which are very different from your canoes. Then one day, Katafa arrived after a storm blew her away from this island. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then it was just the two of us. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin, and gave me the name Taori. We fell in love and would have stayed on Marua forever, but a big ship came, filled with violent men from other islands. They mutinied, killed the crew, and burned the ship. We escaped in our small boat, taking everything we loved with us. We saw the glow of your lagoon in the sky and it guided us here."*

But he couldn’t tell Tari all of that. He had forgotten the name Dick and the language he once spoke. The memory of Kearney, the sailor who raised him, had almost completely faded into the bright, blurry memory of his past. For men who have been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past becomes foggy. For Dick, life truly began when Katafa arrived on his island. Everything before that was like a forgotten dream, lost in the intense tropical sun and the sweeping storms. If it weren't for the little toy ships Kearney had made him, he might have forgotten the old man entirely.

He looked down at the curious child. “I am Taori,” he said gently. “Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” the child replied. “I just ask things. But the grown-ups never answer me. Hey, look at the fish!” His attention had already shifted to some children pulling in a net. He got up and ran toward them.

Dick turned his gaze back to the north. The child’s question had stirred his memories. He pictured the ship that had been burned at Palm Tree. He saw himself and Katafa escaping in the old boat Kearney had taught him to sail. He remembered landing on this beach yesterday, surrounded by women and children who believed he was a gift from the gods, their new chief and protector.

As he stared north, the memory of the men they had escaped from ruined the beautiful view of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate danger. The men on Palm Tree had no canoes. But Dick knew they would build them. And when they did, they would eventually see the reflection of the Karolin lagoon shimmering in the sky, just as he had. And they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick was, in many ways, a native islander, a savage. And yet, the part of him that was a white man was still there. He could think ahead, analyze a problem from all sides, and imagine future possibilities.

That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to fetch three old men—Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. They were too old for war but were expert canoe builders. It was why, when he looked at his new tribe, he noted with satisfaction that nearly a hundred of the boys were almost old enough to become warriors. But underneath all these plans, what truly drove him to consider such bold actions was his love for Katafa. She was his other half, more important to him than his own life, and she was in danger—a distant threat, but a threat nonetheless.

War canoes. Was he planning to fight invaders in the lagoon? Or was he thinking of attacking first, to destroy the danger before it could reach them? It was impossible to say.

A hand fell on his shoulder. He turned and saw Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, freed from the vine that tied it back, whipped in the wind like an eagle’s feather. Her dark, brilliant eyes were not looking at him, but at the same spot he had been staring at—the northern horizon.

“Look,” she said.

In certain weather, Palm Tree would sometimes appear on the horizon as a mirage, even though it was too far away to see normally. They had seen it last night, and now it was happening again. A strange smudge appeared on the horizon, a faint spot in the ocean’s glare. It slowly grew darker and more defined until, as if drawn by an invisible artist, the island appeared—ghostly and transparent, but vivid and beautiful.

With her hand still on his shoulder, they stood in silence. They didn't understand mirages; they only knew they were seeing the island they had escaped, rising strangely from the sea as if to watch them.

They both remembered the horde of savages on the beach, their figures like monsters in a nightmare. They felt the wind in the sail as their little boat raced toward the open sea, and they heard the yells of the men, drunk on rum from the ship they had just burned. And there it was—a beautiful picture of the island, hiding the demons who still lived there.

As Dick stared at this beautiful, threatening vision, his face hardened with hatred. The men had threatened him, which was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa, and that was everything. And they still threatened her.

One day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm what his instincts already told him. They would build canoes, see the lagoon’s glow in the sky, and they would come. Those men had no women. Here, there were women. A deep, primal instinct whispered to him that just as he was drawn to Katafa, those men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would search the horizon for an island to raid, and the light from the lagoon would lead them here.

If only he had known that danger wasn't just in the north. It was everywhere on that blue ocean—from savages driven by instinct and from so-called civilized men driven by greed.

For Dick, the world was just these two islands and the water between them. There was no Europe, no America, no history beyond his own short life and Katafa’s. But even in that short life, he had learned to fear other men. He understood the basic, violent instincts of mankind: the drive for war, theft, and destruction.

Then, the image of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing as suddenly as a snuffed-out candle. As they turned from the ocean back toward the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water. A canoe was approaching from the southern shore.

It was the boat Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They left the reef and walked down to the sandy shore of the lagoon to meet it.
