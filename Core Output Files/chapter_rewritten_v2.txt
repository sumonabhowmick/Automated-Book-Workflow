Of course. Here is a rewritten version of the chapter in simpler, modern English.

### **Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge and looked south.

Behind him, the ocean’s waves crashed against the reef, sending sea spray into the wind. In front of him stretched the lagoon of Karolin—a vast, calm sea of blue, dotted with fishing gulls.

Enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, the lagoon was a sea of its own. In heavy winds, it could be stormy and dangerous. In light breezes, it was a peaceful lake of azure. And it was his, even though he had only arrived yesterday.

The women, children, and young men—the entire tribe—were scattered along the beach in the blazing sun. Some were fishing with nets, others were playing games or tending to their gardens. They were all his people. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his, and so were the empty canoe houses where the great war canoes once rested.

As his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the empty canoe houses, he frowned. He turned his back on the calm water and faced the crashing waves of the open sea to the north. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree island. It was an island as beautiful as a dream, but it was swarming with monsters.

Nearby, little Tari, the son of the net maker, sat on the coral and looked up at him. Tari didn't know much about the world, but he knew that a war had killed all the men of Karolin, leaving the women and children defenseless, without a leader.

Then, just yesterday, this stranger had arrived from the north. He came in a strange boat with Katafa, a girl from their tribe who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said the gods had sent him to be their chief.

The child didn't know or care who the gods were. Alone with this amazing new person and too far away for his mother to hear, he asked a direct question with the simple curiosity of a child.

“Taori,” said little Tari, “who are you?”

If Dick could have answered, would the child have understood the strange story? *“Tari, I come from a people you don't know. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was smaller than you, I was left alone with an old sailor on that island you call Marua, which we call Palm Tree. It’s fifty miles north of here. We lived there, and I grew up. His name was Kearney, and he taught me how to fish and use a spear. He made me little toy ships to play with, not like your canoes. Then one day, Katafa arrived. She was blown here from your island in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then it was just the two of us. She taught me her language—your language. She gave me the name Taori. We fell in love and would have lived on Marua forever, but a big ship came, full of bad men from the eastern islands. They came to cut down trees, but they turned on the white men who were with them, killed them, and burned the ship. We escaped in our small boat, taking everything we loved, and aimed for Karolin, guided by the glow of your lagoon in the sky.”*

But he couldn't tell Tari all of that. The name Dick was gone from his memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, the sailor who raised him, was almost forgotten, lost in the hazy glow of his past.

For men who have been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past becomes a blur. For Dick, life truly began when Katafa came to Marua. Everything before that was like a forgotten dream, as if it had been burned away by the intense tropical sun, the storms, and the mists of the rainy seasons. He might have forgotten Kearney completely if not for the little toy ships the old man had made for him.

He looked down at the curious child. “I am Taori, little Tari. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” the boy said. “I just ask things. But the grown-ups never answer.” His attention suddenly shifted. “Look, fish!” He heard other children shouting as they pulled in a net, and he scrambled up and ran toward them.

Dick turned his gaze north again. The child’s question had stirred his memory. He pictured the ship that had come to Palm Tree, only to be burned by its mutinous crew. He saw himself and Katafa escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to sail. He remembered landing on this beach just yesterday, with the women and children swarming around him, seeing him as a chief sent by the gods.

As he stared north, the memory of the men they had escaped from soured the beauty of the sea and sky.

He wasn't afraid they would come tomorrow. The men on Palm Tree had no canoes. But they would build them. Eventually, they would build canoes. And just as he had, they would surely see the faint glow of the Karolin lagoon reflected in the sky, and they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come.

Dick had become almost entirely an islander, a native in his ways, but the mind of the white man was still there. He could plan ahead, think through a problem, and use his imagination.

That was why he had sent a canoe that morning to the other side of the lagoon to bring back Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old men, too old for war, but experts at building canoes. It was why his eyes lit up when he saw that nearly a hundred of the tribe’s youths were almost old enough to fight. But beneath it all, fueling his mind and his courage, was his love for Katafa. She was his other half, more important to him than his own life. And she was in danger—a distant danger, but a danger nonetheless.

War canoes. Was he planning to fight the invaders in the lagoon? Or did he have a bolder plan to attack the source of the danger before it could even reach them? It was impossible to know.

A hand fell on his shoulder. He turned and saw Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped its vine tie and flew back in the breeze like a feather. Her dark, brilliant eyes were not on him, but fixed on the northern horizon where he had been staring.

“Look,” she said.

In certain weather, Palm Tree island, though far over the horizon, could be seen from Karolin because of a mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it was happening again. A mysterious stain appeared low in the sky, a faint spot in the ocean’s glare. Slowly, it grew darker and more solid until the island appeared as if sketched by an invisible artist—ghostly, yet vivid.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence. They didn't understand mirages; they only knew they were seeing the place they had escaped from, rising strangely from the sea as if to watch them.

They saw it all again: the mob of violent men on the beach, their figures monstrous like creatures in a nightmare. They felt the wind filling the sail as their small boat raced for the open sea. They heard the yells of the men, drunk on rum stolen from the ship they had just burned. And there it was, the scene of that horror, now a beautiful picture that hid the demons still living there.

As Dick stared at this beautiful threat, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened him, which was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa, which was everything. And they still threatened her.

One day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm what his instincts already told him. They would build canoes, see the lagoon’s light, and they would come. Those men had no women. Here, there were women. A deeper instinct whispered to him that just as he was drawn to Katafa, those men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would search the horizon for an island to raid for women, and the lagoon’s glow would lead them right here.

If only he had known, danger didn't just lie to the north. It could come from anywhere on that blue sea, driven by greed or desire—not just from savages, but from the wolves of civilization, too.

To Dick, the world was just these two islands in the middle of the ocean. There was no Europe or America. There was no history other than his own short life and Katafa’s. But even in that short life, he had learned to fear other men and had understood the foundation of all human conflict: the instinct for war, violence, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade. Then, as suddenly as a candle being blown out, it vanished. As they turned from the ocean back toward the lagoon, Katafa pointed. A canoe was approaching from the southern shore.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
