Of course. Here is "The Gates of Morning," Chapter I, rewritten in simpler, modern English.

### **Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral ledge, looking south.

Behind him, the huge waves of the open ocean crashed, sending sea spray into the wind. But in front of him, the lagoon of Karolin was as calm as a lake—a vast, blue expanse dotted with fishing gulls.

This massive lagoon, circled by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a sea of its own. It could turn stormy in high winds or be perfectly still in a light breeze. And it was all his. He had only arrived here yesterday.

The people on the beach below—the women, children, and teenagers—were all his. They were busy in the hot sun, fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to their gardens. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his. The empty canoe houses, where war canoes once rested, were also his.

As his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, he frowned. He turned away from the calm water and faced the crashing waves of the northern sea. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree island. It was an island as beautiful as a dream, but it was now swarming with violent men.

Little Tari, the son of the net maker, was sitting nearby and looked up at him. Tari didn't know much about the world, but he knew that a war had wiped out all the men of Karolin, leaving the women and children defenseless. Then, just yesterday, this stranger had arrived from the north. He came in an unusual boat with Katafa, a girl who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said the gods had sent him to be their chief.

The boy didn't know or care about gods. He was just alone with this amazing new person. Away from his mother, he asked a simple, direct question.
“Taori,” Tari asked, “who are you?”

If Dick could have answered, the boy wouldn't have understood the strange story. *Tari, my name is Dick Lestrange. I come from a world you don't know. When I was smaller than you, I was shipwrecked on that island you call Palm Tree with an old sailor. He raised me and taught me how to fish and sail. Then Katafa, the girl from your island, washed ashore after a storm. We lived together, and after the old sailor died, we were alone. She taught me your language and gave me the name Taori. We fell in love. We might have stayed there forever, but a big ship arrived with bad men. They killed the white men who led them, burned the ship, and took over the island. We escaped in our small boat, bringing everything we could, and sailed here, guided by the glow of your lagoon in the sky.*

But he couldn't tell Tari all that. He had forgotten the name Dick and the language he once spoke. Kearney, the sailor who raised him, was just a faint memory, a blur in his past.

For men who have been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past fades. For Dick, life truly began when Katafa arrived on Palm Tree. Everything before that was lost, burned away by the intense tropical sun and washed out by the storms. The only reason he remembered Kearney at all was because of the small model ships the old man had made for him as a boy.

He looked down at the curious child. “I am Taori, little Tari. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” the child said. “I just ask things. But the grown-ups never answer.” His attention suddenly shifted. “Oh, look! Fish!” He jumped up and ran toward some other children pulling in a net.

Dick turned back to face the north. The boy's question had stirred his memories. He pictured the ship that had been burned, and he saw himself and Katafa escaping in the small boat. He remembered arriving on this beach yesterday, surrounded by women and children who now saw him as a leader sent by the gods. As he stared north, the memory of the men they had fled from tainted the beautiful view.

He wasn't in immediate danger. The men on Palm Tree had no canoes. But Dick knew they would build them. Eventually, they would see the reflection of Karolin’s lagoon in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might take a long time, but it was inevitable.

Dick was, in most ways, a native islander. And yet, something of the white man remained in him. He could think ahead, plan, and imagine the future.

That was why he had already sent a canoe to fetch three old men—Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—who were expert canoe builders. It was why he'd noted that nearly a hundred of the island's boys were almost old enough to be warriors. But beneath all this planning, his driving force was his love for Katafa. She was his other half, more important to him than his own life, and she was in danger.

War canoes. Was he planning to fight invaders in the lagoon? Or did he have a bolder idea: to attack them at the source and destroy the danger before it could grow? It was impossible to know.

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned and saw Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped its vine tie and flew back in the wind like a feather. Her dark, brilliant eyes weren't looking at him, but at the horizon he had been staring at—the sea directly to the north.

“Look!” she said.

In certain weather, Palm Tree would appear from Karolin as a mirage, even though it was far beyond the horizon. They had seen it last night, and now it was happening again. A faint stain appeared on the northern sea, growing darker and sharper until the island took shape, ghostly but clear, like a dream.

Standing there with her hand on his shoulder, they watched silently. They didn't understand mirages; they only saw the place they had escaped from rising strangely from the sea to look back at them.

They both remembered the violent mob on the beach, their figures like monsters in a nightmare. They felt the wind in the sail as their boat raced to safety. They heard the yells of the men, drunk on rum from the ship they had burned. And there it was—a beautiful picture of an island that hid the demons who still lived there.

As Dick stared at the lovely, threatening image, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened him, which was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa, which was everything. And the threat remained.

Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree confirmed his instincts. Those men had no women. They would build canoes and search for an island to raid. When they saw the glow of the lagoon in the sky, they would come for the women of Karolin.

Dick didn't know that danger could come from anywhere on that blue sea, from the greed of civilized men as well as so-called savages. To him, the world was only these two islands. But in his short life, he had already learned to fear other men and understood the human instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the vision of Palm Tree vanished. As they turned from the ocean, Katafa pointed across the lagoon.

A canoe was approaching from the southern shore.

It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They left the coral ledge and walked down to the white sand of the beach to meet it.
